# 🚀 S3 File Processor Project - Complete Setup Guide

## 📋 Project Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive Java-based AWS serverless application that monitors S3 buckets and processes files using Step Functions, Lambda, and API Gateway. The project includes:

## ✅ What's Been Created

### 🏗️ **Core Infrastructure**
- **Gradle Build System** with AWS CloudFormation plugin
- **Environment-specific configurations** (dev, staging, prod)
- **CloudFormation templates** for complete AWS infrastructure
- **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions

### 📦 **Java Components**
- **S3MonitorLambda** - Monitors S3 bucket and triggers workflows
- **FileValidationLambda** - Validates files for emptiness and corruption
- **FileBatchingLambda** - Moves files from pending to processing in batches
- **S3Service** - Handles all S3 operations
- **StepFunctionService** - Manages Step Function workflows
- **AppConfig** - Environment-aware configuration management

### 🔧 **Build & Deployment**
- **Gradle scripts** with multi-environment support
- **Deployment scripts** for Windows (batch files)
- **Test automation** with JUnit 5 and Mockito
- **CloudFormation validation** and deployment automation

## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Configurable File Processing**
- ✅ Monitors S3 `pending/` folder for file threshold (configurable, default: 2000)
- ✅ Moves files to `processing/` folder in sorted batches (configurable size, default: 100)
- ✅ Validates files for emptiness and other criteria
- ✅ Environment-specific thresholds and batch sizes

### 2. **AWS Services Integration**
- ✅ **Lambda Functions**: Monitor, batch, and validate files
- ✅ **Step Functions**: Two workflows for processing and validation
- ✅ **API Gateway**: REST endpoints for manual triggering
- ✅ **CloudWatch Events**: Scheduled execution (10-minute cron)
- ✅ **S3**: Automated folder structure and file management
- ✅ **IAM**: Least-privilege roles and policies

### 3. **CI/CD Pipeline**
- ✅ **GitHub Actions workflow** with multi-stage deployment
- ✅ **Environment promotion**: dev → staging → production
- ✅ **Automated testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, security scans
- ✅ **Gradle-based build system** with AWS deployment plugin

### 4. **Environment Management**
- ✅ **Multi-environment support**: dev, staging, prod
- ✅ **Environment-specific configurations** and AWS accounts
- ✅ **Parameterized deployments** with Gradle properties
- ✅ **Credential management** through AWS profiles

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Deploy**

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Java 17+** (required for building)
2. **Install AWS CLI** and configure credentials
3. **Set up AWS accounts** for each environment

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# For Development
scripts\deploy.bat dev your-aws-profile

# For Staging  
scripts\deploy.bat staging your-aws-profile

# For Production
scripts\deploy.bat prod your-aws-profile
```

### Testing the System
```bash
# Upload test files
scripts\upload-test-files.bat dev 2100

# Run tests
scripts\test.bat dev

# Clean up resources
scripts\cleanup.bat dev
```

## 📊 **Monitoring & Operations**

### CloudWatch Integration
- **Lambda function logs**: `/aws/lambda/function-name`
- **Step Function execution logs**: Automatic logging enabled
- **S3 access patterns**: CloudWatch metrics included
- **API Gateway metrics**: Request counts, latencies, errors

### Health Checks
- **API endpoint testing**: Automated health checks
- **Step Function execution monitoring**: Success/failure tracking
- **File processing metrics**: Batch sizes, processing times

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### IAM Security
- **Least-privilege access**: Minimal required permissions
- **Role-based access**: Separate roles for Lambda and Step Functions
- **Cross-service permissions**: Properly scoped for AWS services

### S3 Security
- **Public access blocked**: All buckets secured by default
- **Versioning enabled**: File history and recovery
- **Encryption ready**: Can be easily enabled

## 🛠️ **Customization Options**

### Configuration Parameters
- File threshold limits (per environment)
- Batch processing sizes
- Schedule frequencies
- AWS regions and accounts
- Logging levels and retention

### Extensibility
- **Additional validation rules**: Easy to add new file validation logic
- **Multiple file types**: Support for different processing workflows
- **Notification systems**: SNS integration ready
- **Monitoring dashboards**: CloudWatch Dashboard templates included

## 📚 **Documentation Included**

- ✅ **Comprehensive README** with setup instructions
- ✅ **API documentation** with request/response examples
- ✅ **Troubleshooting guide** with common issues and solutions
- ✅ **Architecture diagrams** and workflow explanations
- ✅ **Configuration reference** for all environments

## 🎉 **Project Highlights**
